to run you need to have python first. I recommend running this project on version [3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/) and also [git](https://git-scm.com/)

then _open your favorite directory_ and run
``` 
git clone https://github.com/chenPerach/visionExample.git
```
to download the project to your computer, notice that the project was downloaded to a directory called "VisionExample"
open it in your favorite IDE.

in our case we will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
